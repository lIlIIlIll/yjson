Performance claims are backend- and representation-specific. Typed codecs,
`JsonNode`, Pure Compact, Custom Native DOM, yyjson Direct Native DOM, serde
Value, raw yyjson, and simdjson DOM are not interchangeable results.

## Go yyjson DOM comparison (2026-08-22)

yjson `JsonNode` 与纯 Go `dwisiswant0/yyjson` DOM 使用同一 fixture 生成算法和相同输入，
在 Server 的固定 CPU 8 上以独立进程、11 轮旋转/反转 workload 顺序和交替 library
顺序测量。Go yyjson 在 12 个 Read、Write、RoundTrip case 的 paired median 中全部较低；
11 个两侧 CV ≤ 5% 的稳定行中，`yjson / Go yyjson` latency ratio 几何均值为 5.45x。

这是一组跨 runtime DOM latency 对比，不包含 generated typed codec、allocation 或 RSS。
16 MiB Read 的 yjson process-median CV 为 9.60%，该行只作为方向证据。完整 commit、环境、
逐行结果、variance follow-up 与 artifact 状态见
[2026-08-22 result](performance/results/2026-08-22-go-yyjson.md)。

## cjfast_json comparison (2026-08-21)

The current candidate based on yjson commit
`6f2f47c597d4e5141b1efbfaa9cba8e5242e94d3` and cjfast_json commit
`eefdedd1e53c93bb5ada11a96b9b81d88b2c6c65` were measured on the Server's
Intel Xeon Gold 6248R, pinned to CPU 8, with Cangjie SDK
`1.1.0-alpha.20260803040049`, Cangjie `-O2`, and `cjHeapSize=128MB`.
The cjfast_json disposable checkout adds its missing `stdx = 0.0.3` manifest
dependency and links the matching SDK's static JSON FFI libraries; the library
implementation itself is unchanged.

The 37 implemented, semantically matched workloads each ran as a separate
process for eleven rounds. Workload order used a rotation with even rounds
reversed, library order alternated by round, and every invocation emitted
`csv-raw` duration batches. Positive paired deltas below mean cjfast_json took
longer than yjson. Only rows with process-median CV no greater than 3% on both
sides are accepted as stable absolute-latency comparisons:

The optimized large-Map encode path also ran in an independent focused set. It
met the two-sided stability gate and reversed the original result:

| Workload | Input | yjson median | cjfast_json median | Paired delta | Direction | CV Y/C |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|--:|
| Encode `HashMap<String, Int64>[64]` | string | 119.887 us | 132.802 us | +10.82% | yjson faster 11/11 | 2.11% / 1.65% |

The complete 37-workload run had five stable rows:

| Workload | Input | yjson median | cjfast_json median | Paired delta | Direction | CV Y/C |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|--:|
| Encode `ArrayList<ProfileRecord>[64]` | string | 101.547 us | 75.899 us | -25.24% | cjfast_json faster 11/11 | 2.94% / 1.51% |
| Encode `UInt64Envelope` | bytes | 9.537 us | 9.561 us | -0.34% | mixed, yjson faster 4/11 | 2.66% / 2.83% |
| Encode `TemporalStats` | bytes | 20.371 us | 21.534 us | +5.10% | yjson faster 11/11 | 0.85% / 2.27% |
| Encode `TemporalStats` | string | 20.879 us | 21.824 us | +3.65% | yjson faster 11/11 | 1.09% / 1.49% |
| Encode deep nested profiles | string | 94.368 us | 74.138 us | -22.45% | cjfast_json faster 11/11 | 2.03% / 2.72% |

Across all 37 workloads, yjson had the lower paired median in 29, with 25
showing the same yjson-faster direction in all eleven pairs; cjfast_json had
five unanimous directions. The large-Map row in this complete run was 119.239
us versus 132.155 us (+9.50%, yjson faster 11/11), but cjfast_json's 4.01% CV
keeps that row directional rather than stable. Those broader counts are
directional evidence, not
precise ratio claims: only five workloads met the strict two-sided 3% CV gate.
During the run, one-minute system load ranged from 3.432 to 7.111 on 96 logical
CPUs. CPU affinity was fixed, but host-wide load and frequency were not; this
likely contributed to the process-level variance.

The reproducible runner and analyzer are `scripts/json_cjfast_perf_run.py` and
`scripts/json_cjfast_perf_summary.py`. The 814 raw reports, 814 per-process
logs, manifest, metadata, and machine-readable summaries are retained on the
Server under
`/home/chenqian/yjson-cjfast-20260821-6f2f47c/target/cjfast-full36-rawgeneric-20260821-r1`
and in the local ignored directory
`target/cjfast-full37-rawgeneric-20260821-r1`. The stable focused Map evidence
is retained in `target/cjfast-map-rawgeneric-20260821-r1`.

### Large collection encode follow-up

The 64-record array encode result was followed by an eleven-round, CPU-8 A/B
that compared the runtime-composed `YJson.arrayListCodec(ProfileRecordJson)`
with the macro-generated `ProfileRecordStaticArrayListJson`. The generic path
remained stable at 102.374 us versus cjfast_json's 75.488 us. The static path's
median fell to 76.800 us, leaving a 1.46% median gap to the duplicated
cjfast_json baseline, but its process-median CV was 5.29%; the remaining gap is
therefore inconclusive. This isolates most of the original 26.28% gap to the
runtime-composed collection codec rather than object field generation.

The accepted Map optimization has two parts. Specialized `Int64` Map writers
now escape keys and write in one traversal with a bounded 4096-byte reserve.
More importantly, the runtime-composed `YJson.hashMapCodec(Int64Json)` used by
the benchmark recognizes raw scalar codecs and bypasses per-entry writer state
and path tracking for root-level compact output. It preserves the normal path
for nested, pretty, and HTML-safe output, and works across String, Bytes, and
Stream targets.

The focused stable run measured 119.887 us versus cjfast_json's 132.802 us
(+10.82%, yjson faster 11/11). Two independent 21-round runs also favored
yjson in 41 of 42 pairs by about 9.6%, but each had one side slightly above the
3% CV gate, so they remain supporting directional evidence. The post-change
profile no longer reports `pushField` or `popPath` as hotspots; the generic
codec wrapper accounts for 0.27% of cycles, while `HashMapIterator.next`
accounts for 19.25% and is now the dominant library-side cost.

Rejected intermediate A/B evidence is retained in the ignored directories
`target/cjfast-encode-ab-20260821-r1`,
`target/cjfast-map-singlepass-20260821-r1`,
`target/cjfast-map-threshold-20260821-r2`, and
`target/cjfast-map-threshold-20260821-r3-21`. Accepted evidence is in
`target/cjfast-map-rawgeneric-20260821-r1`,
`target/cjfast-map-rawgeneric-formal-20260821-r1`,
`target/cjfast-map-rawgeneric-formal-20260821-r2`, and
`target/cjfast-map-rawgeneric-profile-20260821`. Focused reruns can use
`scripts/json_cjfast_perf_run.py --workload-regex REGEX`.

## Cross-library workload context (2026-08-20–21)

The following table preserves the broader stdx.json, Java fastjson2, and
cjfast_json workload context previously shown in the README. Each ratio is the
other library's latency divided by yjson's latency in the matching batch. A
ratio below `1.00x` therefore means the other library was faster. The `CV Y/C`
column applies only to the 2026-08-21 yjson/cjfast_json eleven-round run.

| Workload | yjson | stdx.json / yjson | fastjson2 / yjson | cjfast_json / yjson | CV Y/C |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Large Map encode / string | 1.00x | 3.43x | 0.04x | 1.09x | 2.14% / 4.01% |
| Large Array decode / string | 1.00x | 25.21x | 0.19x | 1.77x | 4.99% / 3.15% |
| Large Array encode / string | 1.00x | 4.48x | 0.06x | 0.75x | 2.94% / 1.51% |
| `ProfileBundle` decode / bytes | 1.00x | 8.88x | 0.06x | 1.16x | 3.15% / 4.96% |
| `ProfileBundle` encode / bytes | 1.00x | 6.78x | 0.05x | 0.92x | 3.14% / 4.24% |
| `ProfileBundle` encode / string | 1.00x | 6.32x | 0.06x | 0.86x | 2.16% / 4.14% |
| `UInt64Envelope` decode / bytes | 1.00x | 7.92x | 0.07x | 1.04x | 3.03% / 4.48% |
| `UInt64Envelope` encode / bytes | 1.00x | 10.45x | 0.18x | 1.00x | 2.66% / 2.83% |
| `UInt64Envelope` encode / string | 1.00x | 9.79x | 0.22x | 1.03x | 2.54% / 3.71% |
| `TemporalStats` encode / bytes | 1.00x | 4.93x | 0.06x | 1.05x | 0.85% / 2.27% |
| `TemporalStats` encode / string | 1.00x | 4.82x | 0.16x | 1.04x | 1.09% / 1.49% |
| Deep nested decode / string | 1.00x | 8.79x | 0.07x | 1.26x | 3.45% / 1.12% |
| Deep nested encode / string | 1.00x | 3.33x | 0.04x | 0.78x | 2.03% / 2.72% |

This is not a synchronized four-library ranking. The stdx.json and Java
fastjson2 snapshot was measured on 2026-08-20; cjfast_json was measured on
2026-08-21. Java and Cangjie also differ in runtime, GC, and timing behavior,
so the fastjson2 column is workload context rather than a cross-runtime product
claim. Rows are displayed only when both yjson and cjfast_json process-median
CV are no greater than 5%. A fourteenth qualifying static-container encode row
has no stdx.json or fastjson2 counterpart and is omitted from this table.

## JSON literal macros (2026-08-20)

`@Json` and `@JsonValue` were measured on the Server's Intel Xeon Gold 6248R,
pinned to CPU 8, with Cangjie SDK `1.1.0-alpha.20260817040003`, Cangjie `-O2`,
and `cjHeapSize=128MB`. Each of the nine cases ran in its own process for eleven
rounds. Case order used a balanced rotation with even rounds reversed; every
process used a 300 ms warmup, a two-second minimum measurement, and emitted 200
`csv-raw` duration batches. The table summarizes the eleven per-process raw
medians, not the benchmark framework's fitted console estimate.

| Case | Median | p95 | Run CV | Run MAD |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Generated `@JsonCodec` encode | 2.489 us | 2.577 us | 10.47% | 1.84% |
| `@Json` with static keys | 3.571 us | 3.696 us | 8.33% | 1.84% |
| `@Json` with one dynamic key | 4.873 us | 5.497 us | 8.27% | 7.19% |
| Manual `JsonDirectWriter` | 2.046 us | 2.238 us | 6.08% | 0.92% |
| `@JsonValue` build only | 2.450 us | 2.727 us | 8.20% | 4.96% |
| Equivalent concrete-node AST build | 2.545 us | 3.069 us | 10.74% | 8.01% |
| Fluent generic AST build | 17.824 us | 18.728 us | 4.54% | 4.20% |
| `@JsonValue` build and stringify | 5.324 us | 5.384 us | 0.63% | 0.41% |
| Concrete-node AST build and stringify | 5.340 us | 5.390 us | 2.58% | 0.11% |

The paired results were:

| Left path versus right path | Paired median delta | Direction agreement | Delta MAD |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| Static-key `@Json` versus generated codec | +44.87% | slower in 11/11 | 4.13 pp |
| Static-key `@Json` versus manual writer | +73.97% | slower in 11/11 | 7.47 pp |
| Dynamic-key `@Json` versus static-key `@Json` | +36.60% | slower in 11/11 | 9.89 pp |
| `@JsonValue` versus equivalent concrete AST build | -7.07% | faster in 8/11 | 7.98 pp |
| `@JsonValue` versus fluent generic AST build | -86.35% | faster in 11/11 | 0.87 pp |
| `@JsonValue` stringify versus concrete AST stringify | -0.16% | faster in 6/11 | 0.81 pp |
| Static-key `@Json` versus `@JsonValue` plus stringify | -32.61% | faster in 11/11 | 0.66 pp |

Positive deltas mean the left path is slower. Static-key `@Json` is therefore a
direct-output convenience path: it is consistently faster than building and
stringifying an AST, but it does not match a generated codec or handwritten
writer for this fixed shape. Dynamic keys pay for LastWins slot tracking.
`@JsonValue` and the equivalent concrete-node construction are in the same
performance band; the modest median difference is not treated as a win because
three pairs reversed and both build-only series had high run variance. The
large, stable advantage over fluent construction comes from emitting concrete
literal nodes instead of routing every `.put<T>` through generic codec
conversion.

Several absolute-latency series exceeded the preferred 3% run-CV target, so
these values are a same-host snapshot and the stable 11/11 paired directions
carry more weight than precise absolute ratios. This run measured latency only;
it does not support allocation or RSS claims. The reproducible runner and
analyzer are `scripts/json_literal_perf_run.py` and
`scripts/json_literal_perf_summary.py`. The 99 raw reports, manifest, logs, and
metadata are retained on the Server under
`/home/chenqian/yjson-json-literal-formal-20260820-ni926t/evidence` and in the
local ignored directory `target/perf-json-literal-formal-20260820`. The uploaded
source archive SHA-256 is
`21ecdadd74ee24b0a3b3685d02ee586fb6628961acddb2d6b86580e3df30cf70`.

The retained Round-18 architecture was measured on an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R,
CPU 8 affinity, Cangjie SDK 20260803, Cangjie `-O2`, and native C
`-std=c11 -O3 -fPIC -DNDEBUG` without `-march=native` or LTO. Representative
yyjson semantic-adapter release-smoke ranges were:

| Workload | Approximate retained range |
|---|---:|
| Flat64 | 0.59–0.62 s |
| ObjectArray64 | 0.34 s |
| numeric64 | 0.42 s |
| Canada | 3.5 ms |
| Twitter | 0.89 ms |
| CITM | 1.55 ms |

These figures are regression references, not universal promises. They include
YJson-required duplicate, number, Unicode, and lifetime semantics. Raw yyjson
kernel numbers are a ceiling reference and must not be presented as adapter API
performance.

Memory also depends on shape. yyjson is often speed-for-memory relative to
Custom Native on huge objects, while numeric-heavy inputs may improve both time
and memory. Native heap reduction is not automatically total RSS reduction.

The grouped/control-byte semantic-index experiment was rejected and is not in
production: scalar candidates regressed about 47–48%, AVX2 candidates about
93–112%. Production retains the packed 8-byte semantic/runtime index. Native
DOM performance architecture is frozen for this release candidate; release
hardening reopens performance work only after a stable >10% regression or new
evidence of at least 15% realistic end-to-end upside.

## Generated ordered-object fast path (2026-08-17)

Generated typed codecs now probe their canonical compact field sequence before
entering the general object-name dispatcher. A failed probe does not advance the
reader, so reordered fields, aliases, escaped names, unknown fields, whitespace,
and duplicate-field handling retain the existing fallback semantics.

The retained change was measured against the pre-change snapshot on the same
Xeon Gold 6248R host, pinned to CPU 8, Cangjie SDK 20260803, and a 128 MB heap.
Eleven alternating fixed-workload pairs produced these medians:

| Typed decode workload | Baseline | Ordered path | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ProfileRecord string | 825.629 ns/op | 720.801 ns/op | 12.68% |
| ProfileRecord bytes | 863.206 ns/op | 759.710 ns/op | 12.09% |
| Person string | 2974.754 ns/op | 2191.537 ns/op | 26.56% |
| Person bytes | 3015.710 ns/op | 2558.319 ns/op | 17.15% |

The ProfileRecord samples had 0.39-1.44% per-side CV. Paired framework medians
also showed an 18.44% improvement across the six large/deep generic object
decode guards. Individual framework samples were GC-noisy, so their positive
unknown-field, reordered-field, and pretty-input results are retained as
directional regression guards rather than primary performance claims.

On the fixed ProfileRecord string probe, five-run hardware counters decreased
from 753.4M to 675.1M cycles and from 1.823B to 1.572B instructions. Five paired
RSS observations had medians of 91,712 KiB before and 91,636 KiB after. An empty
generic-collection shortcut was evaluated separately and rejected after its
stable fixed probe regressed string decode by 1.00% and bytes decode by 0.89%.

## Reusable generated fast decoder (2026-08-17)

`YJson.fastDecoder(codec)` resolves the generated fast-decoder contract once.
The returned `JsonFastDecoder<T>` exposes non-generic `decodeString` and
`decodeBytes` methods implemented directly by each supported generated,
non-generic object codec. Existing `FooJson` declarations and `decodeStringWith` / `decodeBytesWith`
signatures are unchanged. Explicit read configurations use the regular direct
reader so unknown-field, duplicate-key, number, location, and depth policies
retain their existing semantics.

The final fixed probe used the same Xeon Gold 6248R host, CPU 8, SDK 20260803,
`-O2`, `cjHeapSize=128MB`, 100,000 decodes per process, and eleven alternating
baseline/candidate pairs:

| ProfileRecord workload | Existing generic API | Reusable decoder | Improvement | Baseline CV | Candidate CV |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| String | 2,136.718 ns/op | 1,781.112 ns/op | 16.64% | 3.32% | 2.38% |
| Bytes | 2,272.406 ns/op | 1,890.617 ns/op | 16.80% | 2.94% | 2.81% |

The string baseline missed the 3% per-side CV target by 0.32 percentage points;
independent retries were more GC-noisy under the 128 MB heap. The string result
is therefore supported by the paired effect, counters, and profile rather than
presented as an all-sides low-variance latency result. The bytes comparison met
the per-side CV target directly.

Seven paired `perf stat` runs reduced median cycles from 528.4M to 484.2M
(-8.38%) and instructions from 1.050B to 981.6M (-6.48%). In the final sampled
profile, the previous generic TypeInfo descriptor lookup was absent above the
0.1% reporting threshold; the two remaining TypeInfo method-table symbols
totalled 1.41%. Five paired maximum-RSS observations had medians of 75,044 KiB
and 75,540 KiB (+0.66%), within the 1% no-regression gate.

## Rejected reusable fast-decode session experiment (2026-08-17)

A caller-owned session that reused `JsonFastReader`, `JsonDecodeContext`, and
path-buffer capacity was implemented and tested, then removed because it did
not pass the frozen all-workload acceptance gate. The experiment used commit
`5822c09` as baseline on the same Xeon Gold 6248R host, CPU 8, SDK 20260803,
`-O2`, and `cjHeapSize=128MB`. Two independent rounds each collected eleven
alternating process samples for baseline decoder, candidate decoder, and
candidate session.

The second round's diagnostic medians were:

| Workload | Baseline decoder | Candidate decoder | Session | Session delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ProfileRecord string | 1,365.512 ns | 1,356.914 ns | 508.047 ns | +62.79% |
| ProfileRecord bytes | 1,549.674 ns | 1,508.829 ns | 566.107 ns | +63.47% |
| Address string | 1,520.324 ns | 1,532.868 ns | 532.577 ns | +64.97% |
| Address bytes | 1,550.821 ns | 1,526.123 ns | 608.093 ns | +60.79% |
| Person string | 4,285.274 ns | 4,345.353 ns | 4,466.658 ns | -4.23% |
| Person bytes | 4,845.357 ns | 5,020.067 ns | 5,000.557 ns | -3.20% |

These are rejection diagnostics, not retained latency claims: several per-side
CV values remained above 3% after the mandatory retest, Person regressed in
both input forms, and candidate decoder Person bytes was 3.61% slower than the
baseline. The session therefore failed the requirements that every workload
must avoid regression and that the ordinary decoder stay within 2%.

The rejected candidate did reduce aggregate median GC count by 42.86% and
GC-freed bytes by 45.11%. Five ProfileRecord-string `perf stat` pairs reduced
median cycles from 495.9M to 266.3M and instructions from 999.0M to 355.6M.
Median process maximum RSS was 80,754 KiB for baseline and 58,310 KiB for the
single-session path. After decoding and releasing a 4 MiB unknown field, a
forced-GC probe reported 1,216,512 heap bytes versus 811,008 before, rather than
retaining the input size. These positive signals did not override the required
Person and variance gates, so no session API remains in the library.

The reusable analyzer is `scripts/json_fast_session_summary.py`; raw evidence
is preserved in the Server experiment directory
`/home/chenqian/yjson-session-20260817-Codex` and local ignored `target/`
evidence directories.

## Rejected adaptive session follow-up (2026-08-17)

The follow-up tested a generated shape gate: flat scalar/String objects reused
session state, while container/nested objects such as `Person` fell back to the
stateless decoder. The analyzer was corrected to use per-round paired medians
instead of ratios of independently aggregated medians.

Variant A reused only `JsonDecodeContext` and kept `JsonFastReader` immutable.
Its five-pair Server screen rejected the design immediately: the six paired
results ranged from -6.68% to +1.83%, with no retained flat-object gain.

Variant B reused reader and context only for flat codecs. Its final wrapper-free
screen restored the desired flat effects but still failed the frozen gates:

| Workload | Five-pair session delta | Candidate decoder delta |
|---|---:|---:|
| ProfileRecord string | +67.48% | -0.23% |
| ProfileRecord bytes | +65.44% | +1.41% |
| Address string | +69.73% | +4.55% |
| Address bytes | +57.24% | +4.58% |
| Person string | -1.27% | +1.82% |
| Person bytes | -0.44% | +2.12% |

This was a screening result, not a publishable latency conclusion: several CVs
were above 3%, both `Person` cases remained negative, and ordinary decoder
regressions exceeded 2%. The planned eleven-pair formal run was therefore not
started, and the session API and implementation were removed again. Raw screens
remain under `/home/chenqian/yjson-adaptive-session-20260817` and ignored local
`target/perf-adaptive-session-screen-*` directories.

## Rejected Person internal hot-path experiments (2026-08-17)

A fresh Server profile of the frozen `5822c09` Person string decoder measured
4,378.228 ns/op, two GCs, and 84,410,368 GC-freed bytes per 100,000 decodes.
GC phase work accounted for 20.92% of sampled cycles; compact ordered-name
probing accounted for 6.87%, string parsing/materialization for about 7.8%, and
HashMap/array initialization was also visible. The existing String-list and
Int64-map fast helpers were already active.

Three semantic-preserving changes were screened independently with five
alternating Server pairs. None passed the frozen requirement that both Person
inputs be nonnegative, at least one improve by 2%, and guards stay within 1%:

| Experiment | Person string | Person bytes | Rejection evidence |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Fixed-length ordered-name comparisons | +0.80% | -0.90% | ProfileRecord/Address guards regressed about 2–4% |
| Inline first decode-path component | -5.79% | +8.20% | Direction split by input; guards regressed; GC-freed bytes fell 11.48% |
| Generated String-list/Int64-map loop fusion | +0.85% | +1.39% | Below 2%; ProfileRecord string regressed 3.71% |

Because no individual change passed screening, the changes were not combined
and the eleven-pair formal run was not started. All production code was
restored. The fixed probe and paired analyzer remain in
`packages/person_hotpath_probe` and `scripts/json_person_hotpath_summary.py`;
raw evidence is preserved under
`/home/chenqian/yjson-person-hotpath-20260817` and ignored local
`target/perf-person-hotpath-phase*` directories.

## Rejected generated Borrowed View experiment (2026-08-17)

A source-backed `TypeJsonViewSession` protocol was implemented for every
`@JsonCodec` model. It reused caller-owned reader/context/scratch state, avoided
owned String/container/model results on specialized fields, invalidated old
views by generation, required custom `@JsonUsing` codecs to provide a
non-constructing validator, and released input references on reset, error, or
the next bind. The public API and implementation were removed after the frozen
release gates failed.

The source-verified baseline was the production snapshot underlying common-base
commit `a9c962d`. Measurements used the Xeon Gold 6248R Server, CPU 8, SDK
20260803, `-O2`, and `cjHeapSize=128MB`. The first eleven-round, three-way
alternating run compared the frozen decoder, the candidate's ordinary decoder,
and the candidate View with complete result traversal:

| Workload | Borrowed paired gain | Positive pairs | Baseline/View CV |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ProfileRecord string | +52.19% | 11/11 | 3.65% / 8.29% |
| ProfileRecord bytes | +56.56% | 11/11 | 5.55% / 5.90% |
| Address string | +54.81% | 11/11 | 3.72% / 5.52% |
| Address bytes | +56.53% | 11/11 | 5.86% / 5.89% |
| Person string | +31.99% | 11/11 | 2.87% / 3.52% |
| Person bytes | +42.29% | 11/11 | 3.78% / 11.68% |

All six effect and positive-pair gates passed, and aggregate measured GC count
and GC-freed bytes fell by 100%. They are rejection diagnostics rather than
publishable latency claims: the mandatory 3% per-side CV gate failed, while the
candidate ordinary decoder showed -4.87% on ProfileRecord bytes and -2.49% on
Person string in that View-linked process, beyond the 2% limit.

Several follow-ups separated the owned-only consumer binary, removed eager
View-session/codec objects, restored the original generated codec interface,
and eliminated redundant next-bind cleanup. The optimized isolated
ProfileRecord-string sample reached +54.92%, and an owned-only run reached the
ordinary non-regression range, but repeated eleven-sample runs still exceeded
3% CV because another Server workload repeatedly changed socket/core frequency.
A 500,000-iteration diagnostic stabilized Person but changed the frozen flat
GC workload and therefore was not substituted for the 100,000-iteration gate.
No delayed latency or hardware-counter claim is published.

Non-latency safeguards passed before rollback. A clean build grew from 156.51s
to 172.63s (+10.30%, within 15%), and the probe binary grew from 16,021,376 to
16,613,256 bytes (+3.69%, within 10%). After twelve distinct 4 MiB inputs, forced
GC reported 569,352 allocated bytes after the first input, a 608,920-byte peak,
and 570,080 bytes at the end, demonstrating no cumulative input retention.
These signals did not override the latency/CV/ordinary-decoder gates.

Production contains no Borrowed View/session API from this experiment. The
owned full-traversal probe, baseline harness, three-way sampler, counter sampler,
and strict analyzer remain in `packages/person_hotpath_probe`,
`benchmarks/borrowed_view_baseline_main.cj`,
`scripts/json_borrowed_probe_run.py`, `scripts/json_borrowed_perf_stat.py`, and
`scripts/json_person_hotpath_summary.py`. Raw append-only evidence is retained
under `/home/chenqian/yjson-borrowed-formal-20260817/evidence` on the Server.
